* local Otsu
### Rotating:
* Hough transform
### Find Line width and Line space:
* run length coding
### Split lines:
* Projection
### Remove lines for scanned images:
* Line Removal with Projection
### Remove lines for hand written images:
* Transfer music symbols to another image with Line width and Line space
### Calculate staff line places:
* Projection
### Segmentation:
* find contours
### Classification:
* NN
### Extract features:
* HOG
### Centre of circles detection:
* Hough Circles
### Primitive detection:
* Morphological operations
